# Code Sharing?

We all like to share snippets via jsfiddle,
click Run and see the result straight away.

CI Box offers same nifty approach 
for server-side languages/frameworks,
Ruby, Python, Node.js (others to come soon).

# Continuous Integration?
Create / Edit / Test / Build
your stuff with just a browser,
being it desktop or mobile.

With CI Box you can easily run your code
on any version of your Kung Fu language

Yes, that's offered by any CI service.

The only difference - 
you can manually control everything.
