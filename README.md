# Code Sharing?

We all like to share snippets via jsfiddle,
click Run and see the result straight away.

CIBox offers same nifty approach 
for server-side languages/frameworks -
`Ruby`, `Python`, `Node.js` and `PHP`

# Continuous Integration?
Create / Edit / Test / Build
your stuff with just a browser,
being it desktop or mobile.

With CIBox you can easily run your code
on any version of your Kung Fu language

Yes, that's offered by any CI service.

The only difference - 
you can manually control everything in Real Time!

Just as you do on your computer.
